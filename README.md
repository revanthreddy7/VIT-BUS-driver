# Driver App

This is drivers app.
The objective of the project is to make a user-friendly app which works for tracking of
shuttle cabs in vit. This helps every student and professor to know where the bus is and
helps to plan things accordingly. The main theme of the project is to provide a readily
available location of the cabs in VIT. Ultimately, the mobile app should be something
that the audience will find it valuable and use on a regular basis.

## Scope

Shuttle tracking and management system is to be understood as a reference application that
uses and validates the appropriateness of the interfaces, components and specifications that are
defined for the mobility domain in the work package of the CitySDK project. The aim is to replicate
this in the campus of VIT Vellore.
